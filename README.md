🚀 **QA & AI Testing | Prompt Engineering | AI-Powered Mentoring | NLP Evaluation**

> "I believe the best learning comes when I'm doing something I enjoy. IT and AI interest me, motivate me and give me purpose - that's why I pursue them and naturally thrive in them."

🎯 **I see IT as an opportunity for meaningful work that fulfills me. I am actively learning in QA and AI testing, exploring ways to connect them with practical applications.**

## 🎯 My Projects and Experiments

### AI Templates – Open-source toolkit for testing and optimizing AI interactions
🔗 **[GitHub repo](https://github.com/painter99/ai-templates)**
- A collection of tools for efficient prompt testing and optimization
- Evaluation and refinement of prompts for different AI models
- Experiments with robustness and bias detection
- Testing various AI models and text generation approaches

*AI Templates helped me gain a deeper understanding of prompt engineering and AI model evaluation. This naturally led to the further development of the concept in the ELEVATE project.*

### ELEVATE Academic – AI-powered mentoring system (in development)
🔗 **[GitHub repo](https://github.com/painter99/ELEVATE-Academic)**
- Personalized educational framework
- Planned implementation in Python

*CustomGPT [ELEVATE](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67897b48ea548191849fecba9ac320a2-elevate) combines experiences from AI Templates with the vision of personalized education through AI.*

### PromptAlchymista ⚗️ – Advanced System Prompt for AI-Assisted Prompt Engineering
🔗 **[GitHub repo](https://github.com/painter99/PromptAlchymista)**
- A comprehensive system prompt designed to assist in the creation, analysis, and optimization of LLM prompts, aiming for robust and effective solutions.
- Key features include: dynamic knowledge updates, thoughtful structural design (especially using XML), and adaptive communication with the user.
- Currently in **Release Candidate (v1.0.0-rc1)** phase, primarily optimized and tested with **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**.

*PromptAlchymista represents a deeper dive into the architecture of AI instructions, building upon a systematic and dynamically informed approach to prompt engineering.*
