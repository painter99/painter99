## ðŸš€ Aspiring Software Tester | Cybersecurity & Automation Enthusiast

After several years in the powder coating industry, where I honed my precision and technical problem-solving skills, I decided to pursue my long-standing passion for technology. My goal is to become an expert in software quality assurance and security, where I can apply the fundamentals of analytical thinking and the pursuit of continuous improvement.

### ðŸ›  Skills & Learning
- Manual and automated testing of web applications
- Security testing (OWASP Top 10)
- API and performance testing
- Tools: Playwright, Postman, JMeter, OWASP ZAP
- Programming: 
  * Python: Automation of test scenarios using scripts
- Version Control: 
  * Git: Version management for team projects and documentation of testing processes

### ðŸ“š Professional Literature and Continuous Education

To deepen my understanding of cybersecurity, software testing, and IT in general, I am studying the following professional literature and materials:

1. **"Kryptografie okolo nÃ¡s" (Cryptography Around Us) by Karel Burda, 2019**
   - Practical view on cryptography in everyday life
   - Fundamental cryptographic functions and their applications
   - Overview of commonly used protocols and systems

2. **"CyberSecurity" by Jan Kolouch et al., 2019**
   - Comprehensive look at cybersecurity
   - Legal aspects including cybersecurity law
   - Practical approaches to implementing security measures

3. **"CyberCrime" by Jan Kolouch, 2016**
   - In-depth analysis of cybercrime
   - Legal and technical aspects of cyber threats
   - Methods of investigation and prevention of cybercrimes

4. **"ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level" version 4.0.3, 2024**
   - Comprehensive overview of software testing fundamentals and key concepts
   - Introduction to various testing techniques and their practical application
   - Basics of test management and use of testing tools

These study materials have provided me with a solid theoretical foundation and practical knowledge that I plan to apply in software security testing and QA.

### ðŸ¤– AI-Assisted Problem Solving
I'm developing skills in utilizing AI models for complex problem-solving, including:
- Comparative analysis of AI outputs
- Iterative improvement of AI prompts
- Critical evaluation and synthesis of AI-generated information

### ðŸŒ± Current Focus
I'm currently working on a QA and security testing project that combines manual and automated testing of web applications. I'm focusing on integrating security testing using OWASP ZAP and creating automated test scripts in Playwright.
