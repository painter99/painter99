🚀 **QA & AI Testing | Prompt Engineering | AI-Powered Mentoring | NLP Evaluation**

> "I believe the best learning comes when I'm doing something I enjoy. IT and AI interest me, motivate me and give me purpose - that's why I pursue them and naturally thrive in them."

🎯 **I see IT as an opportunity for meaningful work that fulfills me. I am actively learning in QA and AI testing, exploring ways to connect them with practical applications.**

## 🎯 My Projects and Experiments

### AI Templates – Open-source toolkit for testing and optimizing AI interactions
🔗 **[GitHub repo](https://github.com/painter99/ai-templates)**
- A collection of tools for efficient prompt testing and optimization
- Evaluation and refinement of prompts for different AI models
- Experiments with robustness and bias detection
- Testing various AI models and text generation approaches

*AI Templates helped me gain a deeper understanding of prompt engineering and AI model evaluation. This naturally led to the further development of the concept in the ELEVATE project.*

### ELEVATE Academic – AI-powered mentoring system (in development)
🔗 **[GitHub repo](https://github.com/painter99/ELEVATE-Academic)**
- Personalized educational framework
- Planned implementation in Python

*CustomGPT [ELEVATE](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67897b48ea548191849fecba9ac320a2-elevate) combines experiences from AI Templates with the vision of personalized education through AI.*

### PromptAlchymista ⚗️ – Advanced System Prompt for AI-Assisted Prompt Engineering
🔗 **[GitHub repo](https://github.com/painter99/PromptAlchymista)**
- A comprehensive system prompt designed to assist in the creation, analysis, and optimization of LLM prompts, aiming for robust and effective solutions.
- Key features include: dynamic knowledge updates, thoughtful structural design (especially using XML), and adaptive communication with the user.
- Currently in **Release Candidate** phase, primarily optimized and tested with **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash & Pro**.

*PromptAlchymista represents a deeper dive into the architecture of AI instructions, building upon a systematic and dynamically informed approach to prompt engineering.*


## 💡 Technical Skills

### Current Skills
- **Prompt Engineering** (Intermediate – example optimization, iterative improvement)
- **AI Model Evaluation** (bias detection & robustness testing)
- **NLP Experiments** (basic work with language models)

### Certifications and Courses
- **Certified Junior Tester (Engeto)** - 100 hours
  * SDLC, testing, Python basics
  * Git, Playwright, practical projects
- **Cybersecurity (ITnetwork)** - 70 hours
  * Cryptography, risk analysis, security

### Development Plan

#### Real-Time Experiments & Focus

**Core Playground: TypingMind**  
I'm currently exploring the boundaries of no-code AI development using TypingMind.  
Through hands-on experimentation, I'm learning to design:
- `Multi-Agent Workflows` (complex task distribution)  
- `Prompt Chaining` (sequential AI processing)  
- `Manual Agent Orchestration` (using `@` mentions)  

**Curiosity Areas** (when time permits):  
- QA methodologies (ISTQB principles, test automation)  
- Python & SQL for scripting and data analysis  
- NLP model evaluation techniques  
- AI orchestration tools (DSPy, LangChain)  
- Transformer architectures and fine-tuning  

> This space evolves organically with my journey – it's a live log of exploration, not a rigid roadmap.

## 🎯 Career Direction

My path is heading in two main directions:

### AI-powered / AI-driven Mentoring
Based on my own learning experience, I know how AI can personalize education and tailor content to each student’s individual needs.
- Adaptive educational systems
- Personalized mentoring using AI
- Practical application of NLP in education

### AI in Manufacturing
With experience in the manufacturing environment, I have a unique perspective on how AI can help in industrial applications.
- Process automation and quality control
- Predictive maintenance and data analysis
- Optimization of manufacturing processes
