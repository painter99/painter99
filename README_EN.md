I am an **AI Systems & Process Designer** who applies systems thinking and the precision gained from 10+ years in industry to design and prototype robust, intelligent, and efficient systems.

### My Philosophy

My approach is built on two pillars that bridge two worlds:

1.  **Industrial Precision:** A decade in manufacturing, where quality and process discipline were key, forms the foundation of my thinking. Every system I design must be reliable, logical, and built on a solid foundation.
2.  **Architecture Before Code:** I believe that true value lies in a perfect design (the blueprint). That's why I focus on modern no-code/low-code platforms, which allow me to fully dedicate myself to architecture and logic, thereby delivering functional solutions faster and more efficiently.

### 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are examples of my architectural approach in practice.

#### **ARIS (Autonomous Research & Insight Synthesizer) 🧠 - Autonomous Research Agent**
*   **Description:** My current flagship project. ARIS is an autonomous AI agent designed to conduct in-depth, fact-based, and fully cited research. The goal is to create a system that, based on a simple query, dynamically plans, executes, and synthesizes information from various sources into a structured, analytical report. The entire system is being prototyped and built on the Dify platform.
*   **Role:** Creator and Lead System Architect.
*   **Technologies & Concepts:** `Systems Design`, `AI Agent Orchestration`, `Workflow Automation`, `Dify`, `No-Code Prototyping`, `Advanced Prompt Engineering`.
*   **Status:** In active development.
*   **Repo:** [github.com/painter99/ARIS](https://github.com/painter99/ARIS)

#### **PromptAlchymista ⚗️ - An Architectural Blueprint for AI Entities**
*   **Description:** A conceptual framework and a manifesto of my systematic approach to prompt engineering. It defines the identity, ethics, and workflows for a robust and reliable AI entity within an XML structure. It is the cornerstone of my philosophy on how to design the "personality" and behavior of an AI.
*   **Role:** Conceptual Architect.
*   **Technologies:** `Prompt Engineering`, `XML`, `Systems Design`.
