## About Me

Over 10 years in **Surface Technology**, where precision and a systematic approach are mandatory.

I started with **SW Testing** certification, explored the basics of **Cybersecurity**, and I am fascinated by **AI Engineering**. However, I realized that before building complex systems, I must master the fundamentals. Therefore, I strictly focus on **Python, Algorithms, and Linux**.

## 📂 Current Work

- [**python-workshop**](https://github.com/painter99/python-workshop) — Systematic progression through the Python Mega Course. Focus: clean code, defensive programming, documented progress.

> Significant projects, not limited to courses, will be gradually moved to separate repositories.

## Technical Skills

**Current Focus:**
- Python (fundamentals, data structures, file I/O)
- Linux (Kubuntu daily driver)
- Git workflows

**Certifications:**
- Junior Tester (Engeto, 100h) — SDLC, test strategies, Python basics
- Cybersecurity Basics (ITnetwork, 70h) — Cryptography, risk analysis

**On the Horizon:**
- Python for AI Engineers (Towards AI)
- LLM Engineering (mlabonne/llm-course)
- AI Agents (Microsoft Learn)

> I focus on solid foundations before transitioning to AI engineering.

## Principles

- **Systematic Approach:** Depth over breadth.
- **Quality:** I prefer reliable solutions over quick fixes.
- **Independence:** Open source + local tools = full control.
