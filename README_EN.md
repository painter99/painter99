I am an **AI Systems & Process Designer | No-Code AI Prototyper** who applies systems thinking and a decade of industrial precision to the design and prototyping of robust, intelligent, and efficient systems.

### My Philosophy

My approach is built on two pillars that bridge two different worlds:

1.  **Industrial Precision:** A decade in manufacturing, where quality and process discipline were paramount, forms the foundation of my thinking. Every system I design must be reliable, logical, and built on solid principles.
2.  **Architecture Before Code:** I believe the true value lies in the perfect blueprint. That's why I focus on modern no-code/low-code platforms and AI agents, allowing me to concentrate on architecture and logic to deliver functional solutions faster and more effectively.

### üöÄ Featured Projects

Here are some examples of my architectural approach in action.

#### **Adaptive Architecture Generator (AAG) üèõÔ∏è - An Intelligent Architectural Framework**
*   **Description:** My flagship project and a manifest of my architectural philosophy. AAG is a modular, conversational framework implemented as a suite of advanced system prompts that transform an LLM into a team of specialized AI architects. The system guides users through a structured process, from the initial idea to a detailed technical specification. AAG intelligently selects the depth of analysis (from a quick MVP to an enterprise-level design) and its final module translates the architecture into concrete, implementable tasks for AI agentic coders.
*   **Role:** Creator & Lead System Architect.
*   **Technologies & Concepts:** `Systems Design`, `AI Agent Orchestration`, `Advanced Prompt Engineering`, `Modular Architecture`, `No-Code/Low-Code Prototyping`.
*   **Status:** In active development.

#### **LifeOS - An AI-Powered Personal Operating System**
*   **Description:** A multi-agent system designed to accelerate personal and professional growth. Its core is a semantic knowledge base (RAG) and a team of specialized AI agents for strategy, risk analysis, and mentoring.
*   **Role:** Architect & System Designer.
*   **Technologies:** `Systems Thinking`, `AI Agent Orchestration`, `RAG`, `Prototyping`, `TypingMind`, `MindStudio`.
*   **Status:** In active development.

#### **PromptAlchymista ‚öóÔ∏è - An Architectural Blueprint for an AI Entity**
*   **Description:** A conceptual framework and a manifest for a systematic approach to prompt engineering. It defines the identity, ethics, and operational workflows for a robust AI entity using an XML structure.
*   **Role:** Conceptual Architect.
*   **Technologies:** `Prompt Engineering`, `XML`, `Systems Design`.
