I am an **AI Systems & Process Designer** with a unique perspective from 10+ years in a precision-driven industrial environment. My domain is the design and prototyping of robust, intelligent, and efficient systems.

### My Philosophy

My approach is built on two pillars that bridge two worlds:

1.  **Industrial Precision:** A decade in manufacturing, where quality and process discipline were paramount, forms the foundation of my thinking. Every system I design must be reliable, logical, and built on solid ground.
2.  **Architecture Before Code:** I believe the true value lies in a flawless design and blueprint. That's why I focus on modern no-code/low-code platforms, which allow me to fully dedicate my attention to architecture and logic, thereby delivering functional solutions faster and more effectively.
