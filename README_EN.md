### About Me

I am transitioning from a 10+ year career in **surface finishing technology a field where precision and quality control are paramount** into the world of IT.

My journey hasn't been a straight line. I started with certifications in **QA & Testing**, explored the basics of **Cybersecurity**, and I am fascinated by **AI Architecture**. However, I realized that to be a true creator, I need to master the tools in depth, not just the concepts.

Currently, I have stepped back from building complex prototypes to focus strictly on **engineering fundamentals**: Python, Algorithms, and Linux.

### Skills & Learning Path

My skill set is a blend of certified knowledge and active self-study.

#### Technical Foundations (Active Learning)
*   **Python:** (Resources: DataCamp, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, Python for Everybody).
*   **Introduction to Python for AI Engineers:** (Source: Towards AI).

#### Certifications (Completed)
*   **Junior Tester:** Engeto Academy (100h) - SDLC, Python basics, Testing strategies.
*   **Cybersecurity Basics:** ITnetwork (70h) - Cryptography, Risk Analysis, Security Protocols.

#### Knowledge Expansion (Future Study)
*   [**LLM Course:**](https://github.com/mlabonne/llm-course) Deepening understanding of LLM engineering.
*   [**A Course AI Agents for Beginners:**](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-agents-for-beginners) Understanding of AI agents.

#### Cognitive Skills
*   **Systemic Thinking:** Ability to decompose complex problems into logical steps.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Designing structured and reliable interactions with AI.
*   **Process Discipline:** Gained from years of practice in a technically demanding environment.

### Motivation

I am driven primarily by **curiosity**.

1.  **Sovereignty:** I use Linux and local tools because I want to understand and own my environment.
2.  **Quality:** Thanks to my QA background, I dislike "quick and dirty" solutions. I aim to build things that are reliable and maintainable.
3.  **Automation:** I see AI not as magic, but as a tool to automate logic. My goal is to script this logic efficiently.
